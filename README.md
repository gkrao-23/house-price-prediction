# house-price-prediction
1️⃣ Problem Statement

Example:

The objective of this project is to build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as size (in square feet) and number of bedrooms.

2️⃣ Dataset Description

Example:

The dataset contains 15 manually created data samples with the following features:

Size_sqft (Input Feature)

Bedrooms (Input Feature)

Price (Target Variable)

The dataset was stored and manipulated using Pandas DataFrame.

3️⃣ Model Used

Example:

A Linear Regression model from Scikit-learn was used.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

4️⃣ Results

Example:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 250000

R² Score: 0.88

The model explains approximately 88% of the variance in house prices.

5️⃣ Conclusion

Example:

The Linear Regression model performed well on this small dataset. Feature experimentation showed that size is a more influential feature than the number of bedrooms. The project demonstrates basic ML workflow including data creation, exploration, visualization, training, evaluation, and overfitting analysis.
